# quantumDots
This repository contains the general LAMMPS codes used in our paper to simulate the assembly of monolayer quantum PbSe dot arrays. 


quantumDots-assembly.in is the general script used for all systems. Pressure and run time must be changed accordingly depending on the simulation.
Different start.data files for various initual configurations can be found here, where initial quantum dots spacing and orientation vary. 
l65-1.data, for example, is a system with spacing of 65A between the center of mass of quantum dots, and with the first random orientation out of three (for sampling purposes).
